DONALD TRUMP: You will be proud of your leaders once again. Now, WikiLeaks shows us that John Podesta said Hillary Clinton has bad instincts. Bernie Sanders said she has bad judgment. What are we doing folks? These people work with her. What are we doing? One of her close allies said she doesn't seem to know what planet we're all living in. This is her allies saying this. The emails also show her staff saying she has no core. She has no core. That's because she just does whatever her donors and special interests want her to do.
