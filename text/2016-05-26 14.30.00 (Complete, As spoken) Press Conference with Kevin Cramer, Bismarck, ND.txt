DONALD TRUMP: Well, thank you very much everybody. The folks behind me got us right over the top from North Dakota. So, North Dakota made a big statement and I just really appreciate it. We will not forget it. Thank you very much.

I want to thank a very good friend of mine, Harold Hamm. I guess we can consider Harold the king of energy. Theres nobody like him. Ill tell you, he knows more about it than anybody that I know.

So Harold, I want to thank you for your support. Youve been amazing right from the beginning. My friend for a long time.

And I have been on the cover of every magazine. I think hes been had as many covers as I have. Maybe more, Harold? So congratulations and thank you very much for your support.

DONALD TRUMP: Thats good. Is that right? Thats good. I love that word. He used a bad word because he knows nothing about business.

When you rattle someone, thats good. Because many of the world  as you know, many of the countries in our world  our beautiful world  have been absolutely abusing us and taking advantage of us.

So if theyre rattled in a friendly way  were going to have great relationships with these countries  but if theyre rattled in a friendly way thats a good thing ... not a bad thing.

DONALD TRUMP: Well, look, hes a president whos done a horrible job. Everyone understands that. Hes a president whos allowed many of these countries to totally take advantage of him and us unfortunately. And hes got to say something.
