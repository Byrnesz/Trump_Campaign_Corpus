VOICEOVER: Our next president faces daunting challenges in a dangerous world. Iran promoting terrorism, North Korea threatening, ISIS on the rise, Libya and North Africa in chaos. Hillary Clinton failed every single time as Secretary of State. Now she wants to be President. Hillary Clinton doesnt have the fortitude, strength or stamina to lead in our world. She failed as Secretary of State. Dont let her fail us again.
