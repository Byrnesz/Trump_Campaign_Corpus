DONALD TRUMP: When you read WikiLeaks, when you see that Podesta... I tell you what, I would fire him so fast. He speaks so badly about her. "She's got bad instincts." Oh, I won't even say it. He says things about her that I won't say about her. Do you believe it? I would fire John Podesta so fast. Whoever he is. I don't think I ever met the guy, but he says such bad things about her and others say such bad things. It's amazing what you learn from looking. I tell you what, if she never heard the word "email" do you think she'd be a very happy person today?

It was just learned now, by the way.
