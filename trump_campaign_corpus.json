They will grow government, not cut it -- they will grow debt, not stop it. We are right now in a massive bubble that could be ready to explode -- real unemployment in the range of 20%, artificially induced low interest rates, and a stock market that bears no relation to reality -- are symptoms of something that could be catastrophic. We better have a great leader who truly understands what's going on.", "Our country has a debt which will soon pass $20 trillion. We have unsecured borders. There are over 90 million Americans who have given up looking for work. We have 45 million Americans on food stamps and nearly 50 million Americans living in poverty.", "Clearly, our so called \"leaders \" in Washington are failing us.

Through gross incompetence, we give billions of dollars of high grade military equipment to our enemies. Our President truly doesn't have a clue!", "At the same time, the world is becoming far more dangerous every day. Iran is racing towards developing nuclear weapons. China is exponentially expanding its military power, ISIS is beheading Christians simply for being Christian. In Benghazi, Islamic terrorists killed our diplomats without any consequences.

I build great buildings all over, all over the world, and frankly, nobody can build like I can build, and nobody can build a wall like I can.

We're getting people that many other countries, including Mexico, don't want. They're sending them over to us, because our government is so stupid and so foolishly run that we accept everybody with open arms. It's not like the old days.

Now if that is incendiary, if that's, you know, being tough or being unfair, you let me know. But I think having borders, and having strong borders, and I mean strong borders, I don't think there's anything wrong with that. And frankly, this country had better get smarter, or we're not going to have a country. We're, as I said, we're a dumping ground for the rest of the world, and we have got to create a border. You don't have a country without a border. You know, what's a country? How do you define a country if you don't have borders? So many people have given me praise for saying it. A lot of the people running, they don't want to say it, because you know, you take some heat when you say it. And this has nothing to do with the Mexicans coming in. This has to do with the world coming in. The world is coming in. You're going to have the Middle East coming in, you're going to have everybody coming in, because it's literally a sieve."}, {"person": "Hugh Hewitt", "p": "Now Donald Trump, let's turn to the second part of what the former Secretary of State said. Let's talk about guns."}, {"person": "Donald Trump", "p": "Right."}, {"person": "Hugh Hewitt", "p": "What would you do, Donald Trump, to end gun violence in the United States?"}, {"person": "Donald Trump", "p": "Well, first of all, I'm a huge 2nd Amendment person. I believe in it. And I told the story, actually, it was very interesting, because when I announced last Tuesday, which was quite an announcement. We've gotten wonderful feedback on that. And when I announced, I told the story about a woman and a man living together, husband and wife, and they're up in upstate New York. You had these two killers amazingly get out of a maximum security prison, which was fascinating in itself. And they get out, and they're vicious guys. And the woman was always against guns, I mean, strongly against guns. And the man was in favor. And all of a sudden, she said you know what? You're right. Now they've said they have a gun on every table, because they don't know who's going to pop into their house. And it's very interesting, but no, I've always been a very strong 2nd Amendment person. Interestingly, if you look at Chicago, they have about the strongest gun control laws in the nation. And they are riddled with problems, riddled with problems. And you look at New York tremendous gun control laws, very, very hard to get a gun, almost without exception, it's rampant. So you know, it's like, you can't legislate against this. I'm a 2nd Amendment, I believe in it. You have to have the right to protect yourself. One thing you know for sure, Hugh, is that the people, the bad ones, are not giving up their guns, okay? And you know, you have some people, they want to give up the guns, they want to change the size of the magazines where you can have seven bullets, not ten. Can you imagine a bad guy loading up a magazine, and he says you know, I think I'll abide by the law. I'll only put in seven bullets. You have a magazine that holds ten and more bullets, and they say oh, good, we'll only put in seven, because we want to abide by the law. So the bad people, the bad folks that have these guns are not giving them up. And the good ones will give them up if legislated, and you can't allow that to happen."}, {"person": "Hugh Hewitt", "p": "So Donald Trump, we have six incidents, and let me list them for the audience. We have the massacre in Charleston last Wednesday night. We've got Michael Brown in Ferguson, we have Freddie Gray in Baltimore, we have Eric Garner in New York City, Tamir Rice in Cleveland, and of course, Trayvon Martin. Are they connected in some way, because of the media coverage..."}, {"person": "Donald Trump", "p": "I was just going to say, you're reading them off, they're all so different when you think of it. I mean, they're all so different. And each one of those is quite a bit different from the other, and all very sad and horrible. But they're all, I mean, they're really, I think they're very, very different incidents."}, {"person": "Hugh Hewitt", "p": "And so what, what should the conversation be about? As I said on Face the Nation yesterday, after the people are buried and grieved in Charleston is when people ought to talk about the Confederate flag. But generally speaking, there is this series of incidents involving race. Is there a lesson that Donald Trump draws from them?"}, {"person": "Donald Trump", "p": "Well, one of the things that I watched in Charleston, and I'm there a lot, and we have a lot of relationships over there, and one, I thought it first of all was horrible, and this guy is a sick cookie and lots of problems and everything else. But I thought it was amazing the way the people came together. It was like beautiful. There some something beautiful, even right after this horrible tragedy took place, the way they held hands and prayed, I saw them drop to their knees and start to pray. There was something really dignified, and as horrible as the tragedy was, there was something beautiful the way the people came together, and still are coming together. So I thought it was, maybe it was a lesson, almost, because you see so many problems in so many different locations, Hugh, and all of a sudden, you see this beautiful, this beautiful aftermath to a horrible tragedy. And I watched it, and I thought it was really incredible, actually."}, {"person": "Hugh Hewitt", "p": "But are race relations cratering That is true. That is very inspiring, and a lot of pulpits heard a lot of sermons yesterday about forgiveness such as the families practiced. But are race relations generally in America cratering right now?"}, {"person": "Donald Trump", "p": "Well, we have an African-American president, and you know, the biggest thing that I thought, I was never a fan, but I always thought that when he got elected, when Obama got elected, he'd be a cheerleader for the country. And certainly, you would have thought he would have been much better for African-Americans who are really suffering, more than anybody else right now in terms of jobs and everything else. So you have an African-American president, and African-American youth is doing worse than virtually it's ever done. I mean, we've had some pretty bad times in this country, but virtually, it's ever done, and you would think that that couldn't have happened with Obama as president. So look, I am a big believer in jobs. We're losing our jobs to China. We're losing our jobs to Mexico and so many other places. And I'm just a big believer we have to bring our jobs back. We have to have plants being built in this country, not in other countries. I'm a free trader, but the problem with free trade is we need smart leaders, and we don't have smart leaders. I love free trade. I love the concept. But we don't have free trade with China, because if you want to sell something in China, if you're a manufacturer, Hugh, and you want to go to China and sell your product, it's going to be almost impossible for you to do so. And yet they come in here and they openly sell it, no tax, no nothing. So I believe in free trade totally, but you need smart leaders. And you need rules."}, {"person": "Hugh Hewitt", "p": "But Donald Trump, when you get on a microphone, the whole country watches you. And I call you just an American P.T. Barnum combined with Howard Dean combined, you're just legendary at getting people to focus on you. Yesterday, Michael Gerson said one of the Republicans has to step up and talk about ending or diminishing violence in the United States, and I agree with that. How could Donald Trump help in that? I mean, how do you help stop the slaughter in Chicago, not just the slaughter in Charleston, but generally, what can candidates do to bring down the volume and to increase the peace?"}, {"person": "Donald Trump", "p": "It is a huge problem. It's a problem that's very rarely discussed. It's being discussed by you a little bit, and a few other people. But even you don't want to hit it the way you've really liked to hit it. If you hit it hard and you start talking about, and if you start talking about and going into great details, you get called racist. You get called everything. It's a huge problem in this country. People need to be enthusiastic. They need to love our country. And they need to have hope. They have no hope. They absolutely have no hope. And they have no jobs. They need jobs. They need hope. They need cheerleading. They have nothing going right now. The gang violence, which is a part of this, is unbelievable. So it's a big problem. But one of the ways you have to start, and if you look at what's going on in Chicago, it's like a bloodbath, and it's only in certain areas of Chicago, and nobody talks about it. They don't say that. They just talk about Chicago. I mean, it's only in certain areas of Chicago. It's in certain areas of New York and lots of other places. They need hope, and they need jobs. You've got to, you've got to create incentives for people to go out. And you have to be able to have the jobs. I know people that have, you know, they go to college, kids go to college, they spend money, they borrow it to the hilt, they owe tremendous student loan debt, they have debt all over the place, and they get out, and they do well.

It could cost one-third of the numbers I'm looking at and that's what I do for a business. That's what I do for a living. We need security at the border. We have to stop the illegals from coming in.

So, I told them and you know what, it's a little bit sad because I had a great relationship with them and then they really dropped these young women like hot potatoes. It was terrible what they did with that. So, we'll see what happens. You know, NBC will be next to come. We're looking at it very seriously and we will make a determine in what -- determination. But the Univision's very interesting because they had a contract that we did -- that we signed in January, a very lengthy contract. They competed against Telemundo and others. They got it.

Big headlines, NASCAR, You know what NASCAR was, they were renting a ballroom at Trump National Durrell for an evening, and they lost a big deposit. So now I will rent it to somebody else, maybe somebody getting married which would be nice. And so I get two for the price of one. And with ESPN, you know that was a big deal all over the world, ESPN drops Trump. You know what it was, it was a golf outing at my golf course in Los Angeles, it was a simple golf outing which by the way, they left a big fat beautiful deposit on the table, and they have to go to a course that is not even nearly as good. That's one of the best courses in the world, so you know, it's unbelievable. You hear NASCAR, the ESPN leaving Trump.

And why are they coming at me? Because I'm against illegal immigration, because I speak up for the country, I'm against illegal -- if you look at it, what's very simple, illegal immigration, I'm totally opposed to it. You see what happened in San Francisco with that beautiful young woman who was shot standing with her father by a man that shouldn't have been here. We threw him out five times and Mexico sends him back in. In my opinion, the Mexican government forced him back in. They force many criminals back into our country and that's what I have been talking about, and frankly, people have given me great credit for talking about it. I brought a subject to light. But because I'm against illegal immigration, these people bailed because they want to be politically correct. Yeah, I think they will be back."}, {"person": "Greta Van Susteren", "p": "Let me bring you back -- let me bring you to -- there's a Washington Post article about the Trump Hotel. Now, I was in there a short time ago with you and I actually talked to the workers with you and they seemed -- I have to admit they were very pleased to talk to you. They seemed very happy to have a job with you. Now there is some backlash against you from a number of them. And included in the report today is that many of them came to the United States illegally, became legal, now they are working for you. What do you say about that?"}, {"person": "Donald Trump", "p": "Well, I think it's wonderful if they came here and they are legal. But, I know the company that I hired, which is highly respected, one of the biggest in the world to build it, and we put very big strong pressure on them. They watched to make sure they are legal. And if you read the article carefully, they don't have anybody illegal, they have people that ultimately they were illegal, they became legal, according to the article. I just read the article 10 minutes ago. And it seems to me that everything is very good because they were legal. I didn't notice where anybody illegal was working in the building."}, {"person": "Greta Van Susteren", "p": "Is there any -- are you considering at all -- since you are getting heat from every single direction, is there any chance that you will get out of the race with this?"}, {"person": "Donald Trump", "p": "No. I love it. I'm bringing to fore and getting a lot of credit for it, lots of different elements that are very important. We have incompetent leadership. We have leaders that don't know anything about negotiating. We are getting killed by China. We are getting killed by Mexico. We are getting killed by Japan and killed by Saudi Arabia makes $1 billion a day, Greta. And if they have a problem, we go and defend Saudi Arabia. We get nothing. We are a bunch of very, very foolishly-led people. So I think I'm doing very well. I will tell you I'm getting a lot of credit on the other hand. You know, the way you asked that negative question, I'm getting a lot of credit on the other hand from people that say I'm the only one that's speaking the truth.

I'm the one that brought up illegal immigration. This wasn't even a subject. And I brought it up. And I brought it up before the young lady was killed, and then that became a big story. But you have thousands of instances where illegal immigrants that come through our porous border are killing our citizens, and lots of other problems they are bringing with them. I mean the jails are loaded up. The hospitals are loaded up with people. And it's a horrible situation. Nobody ever brought it up. And then I watch some of the political pundits and they hate when I bring this up and I say how -- aren't we all on the same side? Look, I have a very, very simple life. I have a wonderful company. I have a great, great family, all this stuff. But I want to make America great again. That's more important to me than my company. That's a very important thing, to make America great again. We will never be great if we keep going like this. We will never be great again as a country. And I have tremendous support. And I think you see that, Greta, in the polls. People are shocked.", "I wanted to ask you about that. The latest Quinnipiac poll has you in second place out of a quite a big field, which is, you know, I don't know about 13 or 14 now, and you are in second place.

I think they are making tremendous mistakes. I think they are far too weak on immigration. I think they are weak on a lot of things. I watched Jeb Bush, I think it's pathetic what's going on his stance on common core. He is in favor of Washington educating his children, his weak stance on immigration. He said it's an act of love. What kind of stuff is that? That's baby stuff. So I will tell you I have many people that have asked me to go independent, and I think I would do very well if I went independent.
