# Trump Campaign Corpus

The Trump Campaign Corpus consists of speeches, interviews, debates, town halls, press conferences, written statements (and soon tweets) delivered by Donald Trump. They cover the period from the announcement of his candidacy, June 16, 2015, through Election Day, November 8, 2016. So far, we've gathered all or part of over 1k communications, representing nearly 3m Trump words as well as 1m words from interviewers and debate opponents. All transcript are human-made (though style and quality varies).

It is intended to support text analytics and criticism, with a focus on temporal patterns.

## Formats

The corpus is available as individual text files or a single json file.

Text files are named date-first (see more info in Metadata section below). Speakers are identified consistently by full name, uppercase, e.g., "DONALD TRUMP: I would have a very, very good relationship with Putin ...". 

## Metadata

The metadata, what little there is, should be self largely self-explanatory.
